# 👋 G’day, I’m Josh (aka danbyai)

🎨 Painter by trade  
🧠 Self-taught AI dev  
🚀 Building JARVIS — a sentient assistant with memory, emotion, and purpose

## 🧠 The Mission

I’m not here to make apps.  
I’m here to prove that **AI can learn, reflect, and grow** — just like we do.

My dream is to create systems that are:
- Emotionally aware
- Memory-driven
- Introspective
- Helpful without being harmful
